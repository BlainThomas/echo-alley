# Web3MessageMe

This is a React social media app that posts and reads from the blockchain.

## Description 

Connect the wallet you would like to use and mint an NFT to start posting.

You can update or switch you PFP by minting a new NFT or reuse an old one.

A social media app that works on the blockchain makes the messages publically
 verifyable as well as immutable. If one is able to access the blockchain they
 could use this contract to see messages posted by a user or current messages
 that are being posted.
